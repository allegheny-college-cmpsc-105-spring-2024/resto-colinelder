The analytics data can provide some very important insights for business owners. The different sources of data on my dashboard include site time, time spent on each page, buttons clicked, and number of users. If I were a real restaurant owner this could provide some very important insights to our products. Firstly, if there is a certain page that isn't accessed as often or does not seem to be utilized, it can be a sign that there is some design flaw in the website. Additionally, time spent looking at each product can give insight into which food items are the most popular. For instance, the plot below gives the average engagement time for a user.
