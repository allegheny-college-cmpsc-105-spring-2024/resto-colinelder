This review is for the waffle-tastic food truck! They provide incredible spins on the classic waffle from a breakfast sandwich variation to chicken and waffles and peanut butter and jelly waffles. This large array of waffles means that they are not just strictly a breakfast option- these waffles are able to be enjoyed any time of the day! Of the options, my favorite was the breakfast sandwich waffle. Maybe its because I am already a huge fan of breakfast sandwiches, but I thought it was simple and delicious. As for their chicken and waffles, I thought this addition was a great idea because it branches from traditional breakfast food into into a fantastic lunch option. Additionally, if you were just looking for a sweet treat, there are options for that too! The chocolate lovers waffle and fruit extravaganza were freshly made, warm, and sweet. As for the website, it was easy to navigate and well laid out. I thought that the "where to find us" section was a helpful addition, especially considering that this is a food truck.
